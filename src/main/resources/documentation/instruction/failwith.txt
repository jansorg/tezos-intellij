Explicitly abort the current program.
This special instruction aborts the current program exposing the top of the stack in its error message (first rule below). It makes the output useless since all subsequent instructions will simply ignore their usual semantics to propagate the failure up to the main result (second rule below). Its type is thus completely generic.
