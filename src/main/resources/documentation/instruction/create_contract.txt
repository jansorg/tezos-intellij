<code>CREATE_CONTRACT { storage 'g ; parameter 'p ; code ... }</code>
Forge a new contract from a literal.
Originate a contract based on a literal. This is currently the only way to include transfers inside of an originated contract.
The first parameters are the manager, optional delegate, then spendable and delegatable flags and finally the initial amount taken from the currently executed contract.
